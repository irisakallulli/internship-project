Throughout the codebase, we have created a website for a random shop. The website includes sections for a promo banner, community members, products, and a new products carousel. We have styled the site using CSS for various components like buttons, headers, carousels, and the footer. JavaScript was used to dynamically populate the carousel with product information. The navigation menu allows users to navigate between Home and Profile sections. The site is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly across different devices. The Glide.js library was utilized for the carousel functionality. The footer provides company information and the site is structured with clear HTML elements. The codebase follows best practices for web development.
